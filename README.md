# Hello there, I'm Abdullah ðŸ‘‹
## `whoami`:
I started my journey in the IT world completely from scratch, simply creating [projects](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/zoo66/) for fun. I quickly became interested in app development and decided to make a [prototype](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/329153736/) of an Android app using Scratch (I would then later develop [this app](https://github.com/MrMisconception/TimesTableApp) using `Java`). While I dabbled in `HTML` and `JavaScript` projects, I realized that software development wasn't the right path for me.

One day, a friend asked me for resources on cybersecurity and that's when I stumbled upon Heath Adams, also known as [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.thecybermentor.com/), and his free 12-hour hacking course. This course opened my eyes to a whole new world of programming, Linux, networking, and cybersecurity.
(The new version can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNzpcB7ODxQ) & [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH4JCwjybGs))

As I progressed through the course, I realized that this was the perfect balance I had been searching for, and this lead to me studying at TCM Security's Academy and then later becoming a certified PNPT (Practical Network Penetration Tester).
